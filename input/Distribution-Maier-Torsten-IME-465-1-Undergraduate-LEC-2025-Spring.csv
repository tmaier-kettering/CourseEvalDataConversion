Text Responses,,,,,,,,,,,,
Question: Comments:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great course overall, assuming you have a good group for the project ",,,,,,,,,,,,
The content taught in class did not always seem to be relevant to the project of redesigning the MyKettering website. It felt like the class should have just focused on one or the other.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I felt as though the course was more of a capstone class, and we were doing more writing of our reports rather than honing in on key areas of HCI and developing those skills further.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"The course pivoted half-way through the term into something that I think was different from what most students expected. But in a way this is the most realistic class, as doing custom work for clients and suppliers often times results in goals being shifted and targets are constantly changing. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt the course could have included more lectures/case studies to drive home more of the actual interface design,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I didn't know what to expect from this class at first. Now that it's over, I can say that I definitely learned about intuitiveness, heuristic, and gestalt principles, but I fail to make the connection to the real world and don't really know how I would use this new knowledge at work besides designing presentations",,,,,,,,,,,,
I really liked the class and hope the project can findings will be implemented ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Question: On average, how many hours per week have you spent on this course or section, including attending classes, doing readings, reviewing notes, writing papers, and any other course-related work?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Question: Please identify what you consider to be the strengths of the course (or section).,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very well structured and expectations are clear,,,,,,,,,,,,
The strengths of this course are learning useful interactive tools and strategies such as low-fidelity prototyping or Figma.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Groupwork, hands-on work, and report writing. I really enjoyed the guest lectures at the end of the term.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is an interesting and sometimes overlooked field. I don't know if this was class specific or not, but the guest lecturers at the end were very enjoyable. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the course does a good job at introducing a more specialized topic to students and expand their potential horizon of interest and growth. Guest lectures made it nice to speak to people who are working in this field and be open to discussion about alternative/non-traditional job roles in the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Get to see the full timeline of survey, interviews, low-fidelity, and medium fidelity reports in such a way where the project develops overtime to get a meaningful end result",,,,,,,,,,,,
Develops teamwork,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being able to work in groups makes it so that we can divide the work depending on peoples strengths.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The project,,,,,,,,,,,,
Question: Please identify area(s) where you think the course (or section) could be improved.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe find a way to make it a little less dependent on the group work portion just in case students get stuck with a bad group. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Having to work with a random group was not very enjoyable since I believe that I would be able to work better with my group if I had the option to choose them. I also did not enjoy very much having a required team meeting outside of class time each week, since the only time everyone in the group could fit in their schedule was not especially convenient.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Smaller, more personal assignments for homework, almost like a case study that is assigned for 2-3 weeks rather than a term-long project. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
N/A it is very dependant on the client/professor,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the class could be improved by organizing the class's team goals earlier. At the beginning there was the impression that we would all be working on our own prototypes for the KU intranet, and then halfway through the term (or over halfway) we combined as a class to just make 1 prototype. I'm not sure if it was done this way specifically because of figma or not, but it felt like work each team was doing leading up to that point was wasted or went unused. There were things that we couldn't work on because that responsibility when to another group, even though we spent the time to collect data, interview, etc. This class felt like a capstone class, which is not what I was expecting. Although I did enjoy the project, I may have also enjoyed learning additional material through lectures. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think there should be more case studies that are broken up in a way where you are learning about interface/interaction more. I felt the term-long project detracted sometimes from the overall learning outcomes. Additionally, the project did at times feel a bit more like a capstone rather than a regular course project. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much writing and the class this term depended on things outside of our control (interviews, surveys, etc)",,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe have a server (like Discord or Teams) that allows all the students in the class to have an easy way to communicate with each other about questions. Especially when the course project gets to the point where we are all working on the same online prototype,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While not as much time was needed to be spent outside of class/team meetings, because the project required working with people not in the course, it was difficult at times to stay on track with deadlines. While some weeks the work load was manageable with other classes, there were times where it felt like there was not enough time. Specifically when working on the interviews and paper prototype, along with the analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Question: Feedback for other students: What advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course (or section)?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sometimes, the bi-weekly reports felt more like a chore than they were valuable. I really enjoyed what we learned in the classroom, but the term-long group project was not very enjoyable for me personally.",,,,,,,,,,,,
It's group dependent on how much work you really have to do if the same structure is used. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you're interested in this field, looking for a fun project-based course, then go for it. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Try to fully utilize the different phases of the project for finding meaningful changes to the end project. If you use Dr. Maier's feedback and lectures within your reports you can make a really great end product which users will appreciate. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be prepared to write a report every other week. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make sure that you are computer proficent and know how to look for resources relevant to the project/subject,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make group member expectations clear so that if an issue comes up it can be resolved without severely hindering your project timeline and grade. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Question: Comments about whether or not to recommend this course,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would for the sake of the lessons I learned. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would only recommend it if the person is interested in the class contents,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I would recommend this course, as it allows for a combination of divergent and analytical thinking, which is often lacking in Kettering's Curriculum. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its a fun class for both IEs and non IEs, potentially opens up new career paths for students. Especially after the guest lectures, I really enjoyed those. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Quite niche,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A good project based course that while requires a lot of effort, there Is not really any stress regarding your grade.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Question: Comments:,,,,,,,,,,,,
Try not to show bias either for or against specific students because it hurts their overall experience in the class.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Professor Maier is an extremely engaging lecturer and I enjoyed the interactive classroom environment he created.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Maier did a great job of providing feedback to my group both over email and in person during class. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Maier was great all term. Constantly providing feedback that was meaningful to fully grasp all we could out of each report and section of the project. Highly recommend taking a course with him.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Maier is an amazing lecturer. I enjoy his classes, and he teaches in a way that concepts are digestible and not overcomplicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Really kind and flexible professor, he treats his students like the young adults they are and understands that they have lives outside of class and assigns work that makes sure to not take away insane amounts of personal time, but still engages the student.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think policies are reasonable, and the instructor is understanding… as long as you aren’t late to class haha. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
