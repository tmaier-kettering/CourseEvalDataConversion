IME 465 Human-Computr Interface Design,Spring,2025,Please identify area(s) where you think the course (or section) could be improved.,"I think the class could be improved by organizing the class's team goals earlier. At the beginning there was the impression that we would all be working on our own prototypes for the KU intranet, and then halfway through the term (or over halfway) we combined as a class to just make 1 prototype. I'm not sure if it was done this way specifically because of figma or not, but it felt like work each team was doing leading up to that point was wasted or went unused. There were things that we couldn't work on because that responsibility when to another group, even though we spent the time to collect data, interview, etc. This class felt like a capstone class, which is not what I was expecting. Although I did enjoy the project, I may have also enjoyed learning additional material through lectures.",Highly Positive
IME 465 Human-Computr Interface Design,Spring,2025,Please identify area(s) where you think the course (or section) could be improved.,"I think there should be more case studies that are broken up in a way where you are learning about interface/interaction more. I felt the term-long project detracted sometimes from the overall learning outcomes. Additionally, the project did at times feel a bit more like a capstone rather than a regular course project.",Neutral
IME 465 Human-Computr Interface Design,Spring,2025,Please identify area(s) where you think the course (or section) could be improved.,"Too much writing and the class this term depended on things outside of our control (interviews, surveys, etc)",Neutral
IME 465 Human-Computr Interface Design,Spring,2025,Please identify area(s) where you think the course (or section) could be improved.,Maybe have a server (like Discord or Teams) that allows all the students in the class to have an easy way to communicate with each other about questions. Especially when the course project gets to the point where we are all working on the same online prototype,Neutral
IME 465 Human-Computr Interface Design,Spring,2025,Please identify area(s) where you think the course (or section) could be improved.,"While not as much time was needed to be spent outside of class/team meetings, because the project required working with people not in the course, it was difficult at times to stay on track with deadlines. While some weeks the work load was manageable with other classes, there were times where it felt like there was not enough time. Specifically when working on the interviews and paper prototype, along with the analysis.",Neutral
